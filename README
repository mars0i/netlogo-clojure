To install, copy clojure.jar* and anything else needed a directory names
'clojure' in the 'extensions' subdirectory of your NetLogo installation
directory.

To use, put this in the procedures tab in netlogo:

	extensions [clojure]

.........................

To build, export the NETLOGO env var to point to the directory which
contains the NetLogo.jar you want to use.  This directory must also
contain a directory named lib which contains scala-library.jar.  The one
from Scala 2.7.7 won't work, but the one from Scala 2.9.2 will.
e.g.
export NETLOGO=~/dist/netlogosrc/NetLogo
and also
cd $NETLOGO/lib
ln -sf ../project/boot/scala-2.9.2/lib/scala-library.jar
